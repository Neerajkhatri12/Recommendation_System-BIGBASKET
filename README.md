# Recommendation_System-BIGBASKET
E-commerce platforms like BigBasket face challenges in helping users discover relevant products quickly and effectively. Traditional methods of product listing and search often fail to capture individual user preferences or the nuanced relationships between products. 

Objective:
To develop a content-based recommendation system for BigBasketâ€™s product catalog using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. The goal is to generate personalized product recommendations by leveraging textual data, such as product descriptions and features. This system aims to enhance user experience by providing relevant suggestions, improving product discoverability, and driving customer satisfaction and sales.
